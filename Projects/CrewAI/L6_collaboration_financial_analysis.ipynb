      "After conducting research on the internet, I have found information on the three approved trading strategies for AAPL:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Intraday Price Movements Strategy: This strategy involves taking advantage of short-term price fluctuations within a trading day. Potential risks include high volatility, sudden price movements, and increased transaction costs. To mitigate these risks, traders should set strict stop-loss orders, use technical analysis tools, and stay informed about market news.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Dollar-Cost Averaging Strategy: This strategy focuses on regularly investing a fixed amount of money in AAPL shares regardless of market conditions. Risks include market downturns affecting the average cost per share and potential losses during bear markets. To mitigate these risks, investors should diversify their portfolio, have a long-term investment horizon, and monitor their investments regularly.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Buy and Hold Strategy: This strategy involves buying AAPL shares and holding them for an extended period, regardless of short-term market fluctuations. Risks include market volatility, company-specific risks, and potential loss of capital if the stock underperforms. To mitigate these risks, investors should conduct thorough research on AAPL, diversify their portfolio, and have a long-term investment outlook.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, it is important for traders and investors to carefully consider the risks associated with each trading strategy and implement appropriate risk management measures to protect their capital and achieve their financial goals.\u001b[0m\n",

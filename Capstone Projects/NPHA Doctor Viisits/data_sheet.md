# Datasheet

As far as you can, complete the model datasheet. If you have got the data from the internet, you may not have all the information you need, but make sure you include all the information you do have. 

## Motivation

- For what purpose was the dataset created? 
The National Poll on Healthy Aging dataset was created to gather insights on the health, healthcare, and health policy issues affecting Americans aged 50 and older. By focusing on the perspectives of older adults and their caregivers, the University of Michigan aimed to inform the public, healthcare providers, policymakers, and advocates about the various aspects of aging. This includes topics like health insurance, household composition, sleep issues, dental care, prescription medications, and caregiving, thereby providing a comprehensive understanding of the health-related needs and concerns of the older population.

- Who created the dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution, organization)? Who funded the creation of the dataset?
The dataset was funded by AARP and Michigan Medicine, the University of Michigan's academic medical centre.
 
## Composition

- What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)? 
Tabular

- How many instances of each type are there? 
714

- Is there any missing data?
No

- Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (e.g., data that is protected by legal privilege or by    doctor–patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals’ non-public communications)?
No

## Collection process

- How was the data acquired? 
This data was acquired from seniors who responded to the NPHA survey.

- If the data is a sample of a larger subset, what was the sampling strategy? 
For this subset of the original NPHA dataset 14 features were chosen related to health and sleep to use for the prediction task.

- Over what time frame was the data collected?
2017-04

## Preprocessing/cleaning/labelling

- Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done (e.g., discretization or bucketing, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, SIFT feature extraction, removal of instances, processing of missing values)? If so, please provide a description. If not, you may skip the remaining questions in this section. 
Yes

- Was the “raw” data saved in addition to the preprocessed/cleaned/labeled data (e.g., to support unanticipated future uses)? 
No
 
## Uses

- What other tasks could the dataset be used for? 
Health and Medicine

- Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might impact future uses? For example, is there anything that a dataset consumer might need to know to avoid uses that could result in unfair treatment of individuals or groups (e.g., stereotyping, quality of service issues) or other risks or harms (e.g., legal risks, financial harms)? If so, please provide a description. Is there anything a dataset consumer could do to mitigate these risks or harms? 
There is information about race/ethnicity, gender, age.

- Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used? If so, please provide a description.

## Distribution

- How has the dataset already been distributed? 
2019-05-29 ICPSR data undergo a confidentiality review and are altered when necessary to limit the risk of disclosure. ICPSR also routinely creates ready-to-go data files along with setups in the major statistical software formats as well as standard codebooks to accompany the data. In addition to these procedures, ICPSR performed the following processing steps for this data collection:

Created variable labels and/or value labels.

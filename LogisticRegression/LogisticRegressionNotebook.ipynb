    "In this notebook we will investigate Logistic Regression on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) where we will try to predict the onset of Diabetes, based on certain diagnostics and measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by downloading, and importing the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be followed by a short recap of logistic regression, and the training procedure. The first set of exercises will ask you to submit a short proof that the sigmoid function always lies between 0 and 1, and also to fit the data-set to a Logistic Regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then look at choosing the best model for classification. For this, we will consider the same variable selection as seen in the first notebook. We will then have a short introduction on regularization. This is a very important concept in Machine Learning, it can be used to avoid over-fitting, as well as for variable selection (which we will not cover). The second set of exercises consists in choosing the best regularization constant, and exploring its effect on the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will look at *interpreting* the output of the model to make decisions. We do this by changing the probability thresholds for classification, and explain how we will choose them by considering risk of misclassification."

    "However, we must also consider that the probability threshold of 0.5 might not be optimal. Indeed, consider our current data-set. Let's say we were going to use our model to decide who should go see a doctor and possibly get preventive treatment. In this case, incorrectly predicting that someone will not have Diabetes, when they will, is very costly - the person might face severe health consequences. On the other hand, incorrectly saying someone will have Diabetes, when they won't, is not as bad because the doctor would be able to catch this, and we would just waste a little time. \n",
